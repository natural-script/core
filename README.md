# Jste Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/project-jste/framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/project-jste/framework)

Jste is the first plain natural language based JavaScript framework whch is translated to various languages from many countries all around the world to make it easier for everyone to code and develop his/her own website or application and exploit all the latest web technologies in his/her local language which he/she uses during his/her daily life without the need to any experiences rather than the way of using the computer and typing on the keyboard, in addition to other extra features like data saving and media moderating.

## Features & Goals:

### Project Jste has been founded to achieve the following goals:

#### A. The main goal:

1. Making a new JavaScript framework which is based on plain words and sentences translated to many languages which everyone can self understand.

#### B. The Extra goals:

1. Making simple utilities to manage the databases programatically.

2. Making one local* file into which all the HTML files, the JS libraries, the stylesheets and all the framework media files has been bundled instead of downloading the resources from the cloud and wasting the data bundle.

3. Asking before loading any media file ( Photo, Video or Audio ) from the cloud to avoid the unnecessary downloads which waste data.

4. Storing all the already downloaded images, videos and audios locally as BLOBs to prevent them from downloading in the case if the user wants to visit, see or watch them again.

5. Detecting nudes** in any picture automatically before showing it, and warning the user if there are any nudes found in that photo or blocking it completely if the child mode*** is activated.

6. Giving the website or web application the permissions to control the smart phone native features like toggling the flashlight and sending SMS messages. This feature is called Jste Instant Apps****.

<em>* Available only in the case that Jste Manager has been installed properly and the visited site in http not https. Otherwise, you will be asked to use the live version instead.</em>

<em>** An optional feature in the local version only and obligatory in the live version</em>

<em>*** Available for the local version only</em>

<em>**** Jste Manager app for Android is required</em>

3. Storing the framework files locally. ( Done )

4. Storing all the already downloaded images, videos and audios locally as a BLOB to prevent them from downloading in the case if the user wants to visit or see them again. ( Done )

## The Creativity & The New Innovation:

Translating the JavaScript commands into plain text based commands translated into various languages like Egyptian which makes developing apps and web-based applications easier for anyone.

## Market Size & The Target Audience:

The target audience is every person who wants to develop his/her own website or web application and has no coding experience due to many reasons like the complexity of the programming syntax or having no time for taking courses.

## The Competitors:

1. <b>SQL programming language:</b> SQL is very close to plain English text and it is easy to be understood fast, but unfortunately, it has been designed to manage the databases only but not the websites or apps contents.

2. There are many other projects which have been founded recently to achieve the goal of creating a plain natural language based programming syntax, but all of them are very basic and can't be used in any kind of production.
