# Jste Framework

Jste is the first JavaScript framework translated to various languages from many countries all around the world to make it easier for anyone to code and develop his/her own website or application and exploit all the latest web technologies in his/her local language he/she uses during his/her daily life without any need for coding experiences, in addition to other extra features like data saving and media moderating.

## Goals:

### Project Jste has been founded to achieve the following goals:

#### A. The main goal:

1. Making a new JavaScript framework which is based on plain words and sentences translated to many languages which everyone can self understand.

#### B. The Extra goals:

1. Making simple utilities to manage the databases.

2. Making one local file which contains all the HTML files, the JS libraries, the stylesheets and all the framework media files instead of downloading the resources from the cloud and wasting the data bundle.

3. Asking before loading any media file ( Photo, Video or Audio ) from the cloud to avoid the unnecessary downloads which waste data.

4. Storing all the already downloaded images, videos and audios locally as a BLOB to prevent them from downloading in the case if the user wants to visit or see them again.

5. Detecting nudes in any picture automatically before showing it, and warning the user if there are nudes found in that photo or blocking it completely if the child mode is activated.

## What have been done:

### A. Translating HTML components.

1. Image.

2. Video.

3. Audio Player.

4. Slideshow.

5. Text.

6. Tooltip.

7. Container ( DIV ).

8. Button.

9. Table. 

10. Writing zone ( Textbox ).

11. Checkbox.

12. Dropdown menu.

13. Date picker.

14. Time picker.

15. Select menu.

16. Slider.

### B. Translating JS functions:

1. Setting a timeout and an interval to execute the command.

2. Removing an element.

3. Changing the value, the width, the length, the font color or the background color of an element as an absolute value or based on a value of another element.

4. Redirection to a URL or an Email link, scrolling to a specific element, opening a dialog box or changing the current page.

5. Play, pause or set the time position of videos and audios.

6. Events and voice recognition.

7. Inserting and requesting data from the Firebase database.

8. Conditional statements.

### C. Jste manager:

1. The Installer. ( Done for Android, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD )

2. The Executables. ( Done for Android, Darwin, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD )

3. Serving the framework local files and making them accessible by the external websites ( Done )

4. Child Mode ( Done partially )

### D. Genuine Jste framework version verification ( Done )

### E. Media Moderation:

1. 'Nudes Found' warning for images. ( Done )

2. Videos ratings. ( Under Development )

### F. Data saving:

1. Asking before downloading images, videos or logos more than 200 KiB. ( Done )

2. Storing the framework files locally. ( Done )

3. Storing all the already downloaded images, videos and audios locally as a BLOB to prevent them from downloading in the case if the user wants to visit or see them again. ( Done )

## The Creativity And The New Innovation:

Translating the JavaScript commands into plain text based commands translated into various languages like The Egyptian Arabic which makes developing apps and web-based applications easier for everyone.

## Market Size And The Target Audience:

The target audience is every person who wants to develop his/her own website or web applications and he/she has no coding experience due to many reasons like the complexity of programming syntax or having no time for taking courses.

## The Competitors:

1. <b>SQL programming language:</b> SQL is very close to plain English text and it is easy to be understood fast, but unfortunately, it has been designed to manage the databases only but not the websites or apps contents.

2. There are many other projects which have been founded recently to achieve the goal of programming using the plain text, but all of them are very simple and can't be used in any kind of production.
